              In the morning I walked down the Boulevard to the rue Soufflot for
              coffee and brioche. It was a fine morning. The horse-chestnut
              trees in the Luxembourg gardens were in bloom. There was the
              pleasant early-morning feeling of a hot day. I read the papers
              with the coffee and then smoked a cigarette. The flower-women were
              coming up from the market and arranging their daily stock.
              Students went by going up to the law school, or down to the
              Sorbonne. The Boulevard was busy with trams and people going to
              work.
